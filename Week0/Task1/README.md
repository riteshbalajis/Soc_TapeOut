# SoC Tapeout Course ‚Äì Week 0  
**Introduction: From Specifications to Tapeout**

---

## üéØ Goal
The ultimate goal of the SoC design flow is to **run the intended application on silicon (the chip)**.  
At every stage, the generated outputs must match to ensure correctness:  
`Out1 = Out2 = Out3 = Out4`

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è 1. Specification and Verification (Chip Modeling)
- First, verify whether the application and the given specifications are correct.  

### Flow
- **Testbench ‚Üí GCC ‚Üí Out1**  
- **Testbench ‚Üí Specs (C Model) ‚Üí Out2**  

### Check
- Compare **Out1** and **Out2**.  
- If both are equal ‚Üí the specification is **verified and frozen**.  
- This ensures that the software model (C model) truly reflects the intended application.  

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è 2. Softcopy of Hardware (RTL)
- Next, the application is mapped to hardware using **RTL (Verilog, Bluespec, HLS)**.  
- The RTL description again produces **Out2**, which must be consistent with the specification.  

###  Division of RTL
1. **Processor**
   - Must be synthesizable (convertible into gates).  
   - Should avoid unsupported Verilog constructs.  

2. **Peripheral IPs**
   - **Reusable Macros**  
     - Synthesizable blocks of code that can be instantiated multiple times.  
   - **Analog IPs**  
     - Interfaces with external devices (e.g., ADC, DAC).  
     - Built using MOSFETs in practical silicon; hence, not required to be synthesizable.  

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è 3. SoC Integration
- The application, processor, and peripheral IPs are connected together to form a complete **SoC**.  
- **GPIOs** are added for external connectivity.  
- Simulation of the integrated SoC produces **Out3**.  

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è 4. Physical Design Flow
- The verified RTL is taken through the physical design process:  
  - **RTL ‚Üí Gate-Level Netlist ‚Üí Placement & Routing.**  
- At gate level, the design is a combination of transistors.  
- At the lowest level, it consists of metals, polysilicon, and transistors‚Äîyet it performs the same functionality as the specification.  
- The final physical layout is saved in **GDSII format**.  

### Sign-Off
- Before fabrication, mandatory checks are performed:  
  - **DRC** (Design Rule Check)  
  - **LVS** (Layout vs. Schematic)  
  - **STA** (Static Timing Analysis)  
- Once cleared ‚Üí the design is ready for **tapeout**.  

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è 5. Tapeout ‚Üí Tapein
- After tapeout, the fabricated chip (tapein) is mounted with required peripherals such as:  
  - ADC, DAC  
  - Power sources  
  - Other supporting IPs for a complete board.  
- Firmware and software for peripheral integration are also included.  
- The real chip board produces **Out4**.  

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Rule
To ensure correctness across the flow: Compares the outputs(out1==out2==out3==out4)
